# Dendrogram for comparing Android apps

This is the source code used to make dendrograms like [This one]() for [this project]().  It's not a polished product by far, but hopefully is useful to someone.

## Files included

- dendro.py is the main Python script for building the dendrogram 
- compare.c is a very simple C program to calculate the cosine similarity between files

## Usage

It's unlikely that it will run unmodified on your machine.  README is currently
a work in progress...
