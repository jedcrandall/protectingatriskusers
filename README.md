# Protecting At-Risk Populations from Surveillance, Censorship, and Targeted Attacks

Much of cybersecurity vulnerability discovery is aimed at protecting end users
at the edges of the network from each other, but for some populations there are
also threats from the network infrastructure itself.  Past work to reverse
engineer apps used by at-risk populations has revealed a whole range of threats,
including poor or missing encryption that exposes private user data to the
network infrastructure, censorship and surveillance baked into apps based on
lists of keywords, and vulnerabilities that allow an in-path attacker in the
network infrastructure to inject arbitrary code onto user devices.  We aim to
find these issues in apps that at-risk users are likely to have installed on
their devices, and do so at a scale large enough to have an impact on user
security and privacy that goes beyond simply reporting and mitigating
vulnerabilities in a Whac-A-Mole fashion.  To achieve this the Arizona State
University [Biodesign Center for Biocomputation, Security and
Society](https://biodesign.asu.edu/Research/Centers/biocomputing-security-and-society)
has partnered with [TibCERT/Tibet Action Institute](https://tibcert.org/) to
evaluate entire Android app market ecosystems guided by the needs and local
considerations of the populations that TibCERT serves.

We are grateful for our work to be funded by the [Open Technology
Fund](https://www.opentech.fund/).
